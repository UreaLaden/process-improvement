# CEIS310 - Process Improvement Project

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to bring awareness, instigate interest, and promote the need of using AI and machine learning algorithms and tools for process improvement.

In this module, we discovered how to use basic statistics and begin preparing our data for machin learning in Python using Numpy and SciPy. Both NumPy and SciPy are Python
libraries used for mathematical and numerical analysis. NumPy contains array data and basic operations such as sorting, indexing, and so forth, whereas SciPy consists of 
all the numerical code. SciPy has a number of subpackages for various scientific computations.

Module 1: Uniform Data Distribution

50 values between 0 and 1
46 values between 1 and 2
53 values between 2 and 3
52 values between 3 and 4
48 values between 4 and 5
